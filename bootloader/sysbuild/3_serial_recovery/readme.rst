Serial recovery 
###################

Overview
********
This repository contains unofficial minimal samples for how to configure Serial Recovery DFU for the version of nRF Connect SDK matching the tag you're browsing.

The samples here does not show how to do DFU over UART from the application (i.e it is only for single bank).

All samples are unofficial and "use as is on your own risk and modify as you need". They have not been tested according to company standards.

Boards:
All samples work for the nrf52840dk. In cases where there exists overlays or other board files within the sample repositories, then the sample should also
work for those boards.

Any other board is considered unsupported and adding support for them has to be done at your own leisure.
