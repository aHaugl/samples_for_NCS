# Peripheral Samples
This repository contains samples illustrating how to set up and use various peripherals in nRF Connect SDK. The repository is created in collaboration with Nordic Semiconductors Devacademy as well as for my own training

## Requirements
All samples are created with the nRF52840DK as a base. The various samples are divided into using the DK's LED's and buttons to simulate the device peripherals, and samples that require physical hardware.
